## Notes on 'Introduction to Algorithms'

My notes on the book *Introduction to Algorithms* by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, Clifford Stein.
[Here is an aside, which I did not know until I wrote this page: <https://www.writersdigest.com/whats-new/do-you-underline-book-titles>]

The goal is to learn about algorithms, keep the mental faculties required for such learning in working condition and also practice programming. 
The intention is to invest about thirty to forty-five minutes each day on this learning project.

From my experience with learning, I find that taking note of what was learned in previous day/session helps understand the concepts better.
During my past learning projects, I used to scribble notes on paper and discard them. 
For this project, my idea was to keep the notes such that it is usable and shareable later. 
Also since its algorithms, there will be programs as part of notes and exercises. 
Hence github. After that choice, publishing followed naturally.
