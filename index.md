## Notes on 'Introduction to Algorithms'

My notes on the book *Introduction to Algorithms* by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, Clifford Stein.

The goal is to learn about algorithms, keep the mental faculties required for such learning sharp and also practice programming. 
The intention is to invest about thirty to forty five minutes each day on this learning. 
The grand goal is to keep this learning slot until the end. The next book or topic shall be decided upon after this book.

From my experience with learning, I find that taking note of what was learned in previous day/session helps me understand the concepts better.
During my past learning projects, I used to scribble notes on paper and discard them. For this project, my idea was to keep the notes in digital format and also in such a form that it is readable/usable later. Also since its algorithms, there are going to be programs that need to be written. Hencer github. After that choice, publishing/sharing followed naturally. Also, if anyone finds any errors/suggestions on the notes, hope is that they share and better my knowledge. You can mail me on the github mail id.

Here is an aside, which I did not know until I wrote this page: <https://www.writersdigest.com/whats-new/do-you-underline-book-titles>


<h2>{{ site.data.pagelist.docs_list_title }}</h2>
<ul>
   {% for item in site.data.pagelist.docs %}
      <li><a href="{{ item.url }}">{{ item.title }}</a></li>
   {% endfor %}
</ul>
