## Divide and Conquer
Divide and conquer is a commonly used computational problem solving technique. 
The algorithms that use the technique follow the pattern:
* **Divide:** The problem is divided into  problems of smaller size or sub-problems.
The sub-problems are identical to the original problem, except they are of smaller size. i.e their input data size is smaller.
* **Conquer:** "Divide, Conquer and Combine" pattern is applied again on sub-problems - the sub-problems are solved recursively.
  The recursion goes on until the problem is small enough so that it can be solved easily.
* **Combine:** The results of the sub-problems are combined to solve the original problem.

The aim of this chapter is to analyse few problems and algorithms which solve the problems using divide and conquer technique.
To analyse further we need to understand recurrences.
