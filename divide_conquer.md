## Divide and Conquer
Divide and conquer is a commonly used computational problem solving technique. 
The algorithms that use the technique follow the pattern below:
* **Divide:** The problem is divided into  problems of smaller size or sub-problems.
The sub-problems are identical to the original problem, except they are of smaller size. i.e their input data size is smaller.
* **Conquer:** The sub-problems are solved. Usually, they are further divided into smaller sub-problems until the problem can be solved easily.
* **Combine:** The results of the sub-problems are combined to solve the original problem.

The aim of this chapter is to analyse few problems and algorithms which solve the problems using divide and conquer technique.
